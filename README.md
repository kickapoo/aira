Aira is a web application that calculates soil water balance in order
to provide users with irrigation recommendation.

## Configuration

Aira supports all Django, django-registration-redux and Celery settings.
In addition, it supports these settings:

- **AIRA_DATA_HISTORICAL**, **AIRA_DATA_FORECAST**. Absolute paths to
  directories holding TIFF files with spatial meteorological data.
  "Historical" is measured data, whereas "forecast" refers to
  meteorological forecasts. The filename format is
  `daily_{variable}-{YYYY-MM-DD}.tif` where `{variable}` is one of
  `evaporation`, `humidity`, `humidity_max`, `humidity_min`, `rain`,
  `solar_radiation`, `temperature`, `temperature_max`, `temperature_min` and
  `wind_speed`. Only `evaporation` is actually used for calculations,
  and the rest are used for showing on the front page map (with the help
  of mapserver) and for extracting historical data for a point (i.e. an
  (agri)field).

- **AIRA_DATA_SOIL**. Absolute path to a directory holding TIFF files
  with data for the soil. See "Soil data" below.

- **AIRA_TIMESERIES_CACHE_DIR**. Absolute path to a directory where it
  caches point time series. When the historical data for an agrifield
  are requested, aira extracts them from the rasters in
  `AIRA_DATA_HISTORICAL`. Since this is a time-consuming operation, it
  caches the result in `AIRA_TIMESERIES_CACHE_DIR` in case they are
  re-requested.

- **AIRA_MAPSERVER_BASE_URL**. The raster maps for the front page are
  served by a geographical server such as mapserver or geoserver. This
  is the URL of the geographical server, such as
  `https://arta.interregir2ma.eu/mapserver/` or `/mapserver/`.

- **AIRA_DEMO_USER_INITIAL_AGRIFIELDS**. When running `python manage.py
  demo_user` on an empty installation, the demo user and some demo
  fields are created. This holds the initial agrifields to be created
  (see `aira_project/settings/base.py` for details).

- **AIRA_MAP_DEFAULT_CENTER**, **AIRA_MAP_DEFAULT_ZOOM**. The default
  center for the map as a (longitude, latitude) tuple of floats, and the
  default zoom, as an integer. This defines the initial centering and
  zooming of a map if there's no reason to do something else (e.g. if a
  map shows agrifields, it might center and zoom on the agrifields).

- **AIRA_CELERY_SEND_TASK_ERROR_EMAILS**. By default, this has the value
  `False`. If you set it to `True`, whenever a Celery task encounters an
  error (raises an uncaught exception), the admins will be emailed.

## Soil data

Part of the configuration is a set of GeoTIFF files with information
about the soil. These files are placed in the directory specified by
`AIRA_DATA_SOIL`. The files are these:

- **fc.tif**. The field capacity.
- **theta_s.tif**. Water content when saturated.
- **pwp.tif**. The permanent wilting point.
- **a_1d.tif** and **b.tif**. Parameters used when calculating
  draintime.
